			<h2 class='BackHeader'>Our philosophy</h2>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>Work isn't about walking in to a cubicle and pushing papers all day. Work is being empowered to help build something extraordinary, where one person can make a difference that touches the lives of millions. We don't know if we'll succeed and reach all of our goals. But it would be a shame to not try and create something amazing.</p>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>Our team is at the intersection of passion and impact. We are passionate about <%= link_to "liberating human creativity", team_url(anchor: "mission") %>, and we know that building a sustainable, global business allows us to make the greatest impact. We work to build an incredibly successful business, knowing that profit can be reinvested to compound our contribution to the world.</p>

			<h2 class='BackHeader'>What we look for</h2>
			<h3 class='SectionHeader'>Passion</h3>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>You're driven by the desire to design, create, and make an impact on the world. You solve problems in your sleep (and in the shower) and can't wait to implement your solution.</p>
			<h3 class='SectionHeader'>Initiative</h3>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>You don't wait for someone to tell you what to do. You take on projects because they seem interesting, and you take pride in the finished product. You identify things that need to be done, and you own those tasks.</p>
			<h3 class='SectionHeader'>Maverick</h3>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>You challenge ideas, authority, and the status quo. You see solutions that others don't, you understand something that others don't, and you push yourself and your peers to discover more and achieve enlightenment.</p>
			<h3 class='SectionHeader'>Skill</h3>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>You know what you're doing. If you're a developer, you can build websites in your sleep. If you're a designer, you can design icons and UIs that bring joy to users. And if you're a devigner (developer-designer), then we'd love to get in touch!</p>
