			<h2 class='BackHeader'>Our mission</h2>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>Humans are not machines. We live, breathe, and are capable of coming up with innovative new ideas and incredible works of art. But too often our environment stifles our ability to do great things. Tradition, regulation, and excessive commercialization have slowed the rate of progress in our world.</p>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>nepTune's mission is to liberate human creativity. We're creating a world where people want to push boundaries. We're bringing people together from all over the world, so that great creations are shared with a global audience.</p>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>We start with music because it's a creative field ravaged by bureaucracy and generic content. Music is an art that touches everyone, and for centuries it evolved through many different styles. Musicians dared to push boundaries and experiment with new sounds. But now we find music manufactured to be catchy, to generate the most sales. Instead, we're creating nepTune Music to bring the art back into music. It's an incredible first step into the future of the creative world.</p>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>At nepTune Music, we envision a world where people are able to explore, create, and make a career out of it. We envision a world where people can discover and enjoy great music from around the globe, a world where artists deserve to make a living from the work. We envision a world where people have the freedom to do great things.</p>
