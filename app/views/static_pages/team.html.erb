			<h2 class='BackHeader'>Our mission</h2>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>Humans are not machines. We live, breathe, and come up with innovative new ideas and incredible works of art. But too often our environment stifles our ability to do great things. Tradition, regulation, and excessive commercialization have slowed the rate of progress in our world.</p>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>nepTune's mission is to liberate human creativity. We're creating a world where people want to push boundaries. We're bringing people together from all over the world, so that great creations are shared with a global audience.</p>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>We start with music because it's a creative field ravaged by bureaucracy and generic content. Music is an art that touches everyone, and for centuries, it evolved through many different styles. Musicians dared to push boundaries and experiment with new sounds. But now we find music that is manufactured to be catchy, to generate the most sales. We think this is wrong, and that music is broken. Instead, we want to bring the art back into music. We want to bring artists back into communities &mdash; communities that stretch across our planet. It's an incredible first step into the future of the creative world.</p>
			<p class='BackBlurb'>At nepTune, we envision a world where people are able to explore, create, and make a career out of it. We envision a world where people can discover and enjoy great music from around the globe, a world where artists deserve to make a living from the work. We envision a world where people have the freedom to do great things.</p>
